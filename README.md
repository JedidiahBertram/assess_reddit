Alright! My second go at writing this readme file! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

So. This is a reddit clone. It is an assessment project for the G45 cohort at Galvanize Austin, taught
by FEARLESS ZUBAIR!!!

I say fearless because he took on teaching me. *snickers*

For this assessment we must create a reddit clone app that has full CRUD (create, read, update, destroy)
for a users table, and have views (.ejs pages) set up for all of those functions.

We also must have a post table set up in the data base that is associated with users.

And, this here readme file.

To accomplish this I need to:
   -Get the project set up.
      -Set up repo on git hub.
      -Link project to the repo.
      -Install all dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc.)
      -Set up project to work with dependencies in server.js file
      -Set knex file to work with postgres.
      -Create folders and files as neccessary
          -this includes the views (.ejs) files, route files, seed files, home page files etc.
      -Create and set up migration files. 

   -Create and set up server.
      -Nodemon, listeners, and such.

   -Create EJS pages and routes
      -This means writing EJS code and routes the communicate and work with each other.
      -Also need them to be set up in the server.js page.


That's pretty much it in a very general sense.

I'm sure I'll add much more to this readme as the project continues.
